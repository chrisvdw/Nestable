Please note that this is a fork from tchapi/Nestable, which is an updated fork of David Bushell's Nestable jQuery Plugin. This specific nestable was cleaned up and will be updated whenever a bug is addressed from SumoStore's Community (https://www.sumostore.net/).

You are, of course, free to use this fork. However, please note that at any moment things may change to fit SumoStore's needs, in which case you'd probably want to fall back to tchapi/Nestable's fork :)

Cheerios!
